Installation
------------

#. Install django-datetime-widget using pip. For example::

    pip install django-datetime-widget

#. Add  ``datetimewidget`` to your INSTALLED_APPS.

If you want to use localization:

#. Set USE_L10N = True, USE_TZ = True  and USE_I18N = True in settings.py

#. Add 'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py

#. When you create the widget add usel10n = True like attribute : DateTimeWidget(usel10n=True)

Basic Configuration
-------------------
#. Create your model-form and set  DateTimeWidget widget to your DateTimeField  ::

    from datetimewidget.widgets import DateTimeWidget

    class yourForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = yourModel
            widgets = {
                #Use localization
                'datetime': DateTimeWidget(attrs={'id':"yourdatetimeid"}, usel10n = True)
            }

#. Download `twitter bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_  to your static file folder.

#. Add in your form template links to jquery, bootstrap and form.media::

    <head>
    ....
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <link href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
        <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/bootstrap.js"></script>
        {{ form.media }}

    ....
    </head>
    <body>
        <form  action="" method="POST">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_table }}
        <input id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    </body>


#. Optional: you can add option dictionary to DatetimeWidget to customize your input, for example to have date time with meridian::


        dateTimeOptions = {
        'format': 'dd/mm/yyyy HH:ii P',
        'autoclose': 'true',
        'showMeridian' : 'true'
        }
        widgets = {
            #NOT Use localization and set a default format
            'datetime': DateTimeWidget(options = dateTimeOptions)
            }

!!! If you add 'format' into options and in the same time set usel10n as True the first one is ignored. !!!
